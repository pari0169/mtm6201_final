Final Assignment Portfolio

## Process:
In this project, I built upon the mockups, wireframes, and design elements created during the high-fidelity wireframe project in the User Experience Design course. The site was developed using the Bootstrap framework, allowing flexibility in the number of pages included, based on the projectâ€™s needs.

## Challenges:
One of the challenges I faced was integrating skip links, a technique we recently covered, which required some troubleshooting. Additionally, I encountered difficulties in making the site fully responsive using both Bootstrap and media queries, which required extra attention and learning.

## Learning:
Throughout this project, I gained proficiency in using the Bootstrap framework, particularly in enhancing accessibility features. I also learned how to incorporate animations into the website, further enriching the user experience.
